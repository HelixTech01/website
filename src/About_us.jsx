                    <p className="text-justify">
                      Helix Tech-IT Solutions was founded to bridge the gap
                      between IT candidates and the companies that need them.

                      Quality IT professionals are great at their profession,
                      but that doesn’t mean they’re great at finding work. Many
                      top universities produce reliable professionals, but don’t
                      equip them with the skills to find a position that
                      maximizes their talent. That’s where Helix Tech-IT
                      Solutions comes in.
